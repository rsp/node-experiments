Some experiments performed on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
Because programming is an experimental science.

Prerequisites
-------------
Some experiments are only shell scripts and don't run any Node code.
Some are Node programs.

* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/)
* [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) with Perl regular expression support (like [GNU Grep](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/))
* Node

It should work on any standard Linux/Unix distribution. If it doesn't,
please [sumbit an issue](https://github.com/rsp/node-releases-experiments/issues).

It was written and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with various versions of Node.
