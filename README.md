https://github.com/rsp/node-experiments

Some experiments performed on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
Because programming is an experimental science.

Observations
------------
### Stream events

On Node v0.10.31 the behavior of stdin stream events seem strange
in that sometimes the 'ready' event gets fired immediately before the end of input
(but not always).
Also it is not consistent with different types of input
(e.g. `cat file | program` is not consistent with `program < file` -
but not when file is something like `/dev/fd/63` in which case it is consistent with the pipe).
When you listen only for certain events but not all then it gets even more complicated
and in some cases no input can give you more events than some input.
See below.

Prerequisites
-------------
Some experiments are only shell scripts and don't run any Node code.
Some are Node programs.

* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/)
* [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) with Perl regular expression support (like [GNU Grep](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/))
* Node

It should work on any standard Linux/Unix distribution. If it doesn't,
please [sumbit an issue](https://github.com/rsp/node-releases-experiments/issues).

It was written and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with various versions of Node.

Streams
-------
Experiments with Node.js streams.

### `stdin-events-all.js`

Shows what events are fired **with** a 'data' event handler.

---

#### First, no input:

Running from terminal with no input redirection:
```
$ ./stdin-events-all.js
```
When immediately sending EOT with Ctrl+D then those events are fired, in that order:

1. stdin readable
2. stdin end
3. stdin close

---

Running with stdin set to /dev/null or to an empty file with `<` redirection in shell:
```
$ ./stdin-events-all.js < /dev/null
$ ./stdin-events-all.js < empty-file
```
Only one event is fired:

1. stdin end

---

Running with `cat /dev/null` or `cat empty-file` piped to stdin with `|` redirection:
```
$ cat /dev/null | ./stdin-events-all.js
```
Three events are fired:

1. stdin readable
2. stdin end
3. stdin close

---

Running with stdin set to the output of `cat /dev/null` or `cat empty-file` with `<` redirection via a `/dev/fd/*` file using the `<(command)` syntax in shell:
```
$ ./stdin-events-all.js < <(cat empty-file)
$ ./stdin-events-all.js < <(cat /dev/null)
```
Three events are fired:

1. stdin readable
2. stdin end
3. stdin close

---

#### Now with some input, a single newline:

Running from terminal with no input redirection:
```
$ ./stdin-events-all.js
```

When first some input is given (for example by hitting Enter) and then EOT (with Ctrl+D) then this is what is fired, in that order - 1-2 are fired after Enter, 3-5 are fired after Ctrl+D:

1. stdin data
2. stdin readable
3. stdin readable
4. stdin end
5. stdin close


### `stdin-events-nodata.js`

Shows what events are fired **without** a 'data' event handler.

---

#### No input:

Running the program from terminal with no stdin redirection:
```
$ ./stdin-events-nodata.js
```
We get the 'readable' event but not 'end' and 'close' - even though we listen to them:

1. stdin readable

This is **different** than when we also listed to 'data' for the same input.

(Also compare with `cat | ./stdin-events-nodata.js`)

---

Running with /dev/null or an empty file redirected to stdin with `<`:
```
$ ./stdin-events-nodata.js < /dev/null
$ ./stdin-events-nodata.js < empty-file
```
We get one event:

1. stdin end

This time this is **the same** as when we listen to 'data' for the same kind of input.

---

Piping `cat` with an empty file to a program with no 'data' handler:
```
$ cat empty-file | ./stdin-events-nodata.js
$ cat /dev/null | ./stdin-events-nodata.js
```
fires 3 events:

1. stdin readable
2. stdin end
3. stdin close

But piping `cat` with a non-empty file with no 'data' handler:
```
$ cat one-newline | ./stdin-events-nodata.js
$ echo | ./stdin-events-nodata.js
```
fires only 1 event:

1. stdin readable


Releases
--------
Experiments on Node.js releases.

### `dist-versions`

Usage: `./dist-versions`

Prints the versions of Node that have their own directory (not just single tarballs).
(It will be needed later.)
